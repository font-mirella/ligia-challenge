# Converge Challenge — Site

Event website for **Converge Challenge**, the AI Agents hackathon powered by Tako
and organized by Ligia (CIn-UFPE) and Canastra Ventures. Built with Vite + React.
Live at https://convergechallenge.cin.ufpe.br. The copy is in Portuguese (pt-BR).

## Run

```sh
cd site
npm install
npm run dev       # local dev server
npm run build     # production build in site/dist
npm run preview   # serve the build locally
```

## Editing content

- **Event facts** (dates, hours, venue, participants, application window), the **Luma links**
  and the **contact email** all live in [`src/config.js`](src/config.js).
  Every section reads from there.
- **SEO:** the `<head>` gets a schema.org `Event` (JSON-LD) built from `config.js`
  by a small plugin in `vite.config.js`. The public URL (`SITE_URL`) is repeated in
  `index.html` (canonical, `og:url`), `public/robots.txt` and `public/sitemap.xml`.
- **Schedule:** `DAYS` in `src/components/Schedule.jsx`.
- **FAQ:** `QUESTIONS` in `src/components/Faq.jsx`.
- **Sponsorship tiers** (benefits only, no prices): `TIERS` in
  `src/components/Sponsor.jsx`.
- **Partner logos** (blurbs too): `src/components/Logos.jsx`, in the tiers of the
  event's partner chart. The event logo with "powered by Tako" (Tako bought naming rights)
  must always show; organizers (Ligia, Canastra) whenever possible; partners
  (Porto Digital, CIn-UFPE, CESAR, TAIL) and supporters (AWS, Featherless) when there is room.
  `converge-logo.svg` is the official logo. Porto Digital, CESAR and Tako were cropped
  from the partner chart, CIn-UFPE comes from the CIn portal (recolored for dark
  backgrounds), and the other SVGs come from the old institutional deck's logo sprite.
- **Share image:** `public/og-image.jpg` (1200×630, used by `og:image`). Its source is
  [`scripts/og-image.html`](scripts/og-image.html); the render command is in that file.
  Regenerate it when the partners change.

## Structure

```
src/
  config.js            event facts, Luma URLs, contact, nav links
  App.jsx              section order
  styles/global.css    design tokens (navy / orange), type, buttons, reveal-on-scroll
  components/          one component + CSS file per section
  hooks/               in-view, reduced-motion, page-wide reveal/spotlight effects
  lib/ascii.js         static ASCII art backgrounds (#*+= motif from the deck)
public/                favicon, share image, robots.txt, sitemap.xml
scripts/og-image.html  source of the share image
```

Fonts are self-hosted through Fontsource: **Geist** (body), **Geist Mono**
(headlines, labels) and **Instrument Serif** italic (accent words).

Animations (ASCII torus, text scramble, typing terminal, count-ups, countdown)
pause off screen and turn off for visitors with `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Deploy

Pushing to `main` runs [`.github/workflows/pages.yml`](../.github/workflows/pages.yml),
which builds this app and publishes it to GitHub Pages under `/site/`
(https://automlsummerschool.cin.ufpe.br/ligia-challenge/site/). The CIn proxy
serves that path at **https://convergechallenge.cin.ufpe.br**, so keep the site
under `/site/`. The Pages root only redirects to the official domain.

`vite.config.js` uses `base: './'`, so the same `dist/` also works on any
other host (Vercel, Netlify, a sub-path) without changes.
